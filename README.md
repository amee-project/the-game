# The Game

An interactive game client (based on the Cave Adventure UI) to navigate a 2d maze.

This client needs to access an existing Maze Server (see http://github.com/amee-project/maze-server).

 * Download the repo
 * Install dependencies (`$ npm install`)
 * Run the client (`$ node app.js`)
 * Load the HTML UI (`http://localhost:3000/index.html`)
 * Explore!
